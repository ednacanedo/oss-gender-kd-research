# On the Contributions from Women Key Developers to Open-Source Communities

## Abstract

Participation of women in open-source communities is surrounded by several challenges---including gender bias,
the difficulty of engagement, and general acceptance of the community-which might explain the small percentage
of women contributing to the development of open-source systems. Although the underrepresentation of
women in open-source communities has been explored in a number of research studies, little is known about the participation
of women as key developers in open-source communities, the characterization of their contributions to the development
of open-source systems, and how they understand gender bias in open-source communities. To mitigate this lacuna,
in this paper we present the results of a mixed-method study about the contributions of women key developers
to open-source communitites and their perceptions on gender bias. We first  perform a comprehensive study on
the women contribution in open-source systems, considering 1500 projects written in the 15 most popular programming languages on GitHub.
We identify the gender of the contributors using two classification algorithms (Gender Computer and Namsor) and identify key developers using
the Truck Factor approach---which can be used to identify the lead source code contributors of a project. We use statistical methods
to characterize the contributions of women key developers in terms of commits and pull-requests they made. 
We also survey the women key developers to collect their perceptions about possible gender bias they have observed
while contributing to open-source, to identify possible measures to make open-source communities more inclusive, and to understand
how they perceive the importance of the research on gender bias on open-source communities. Considering all 1500 projects,
we found 59 women key developers (among 2302 male key developers and 279 key developers that we could not identify the gender).
We received answers to our survey from 35 developers (out of 42 women key open-source developers that we manually confirm the gender).
In general, they are young developers that have not been contributing to open-source projects for a long time. Most of the
respondents (65.7\%) report never having experienced gender discrimination while contributing to a open-source project.
In addition, to increase the participation of women in open-source communities, the respondents suggest the women involvement in
meetups and to promote more women as mentors. Based on our findings, we argue that the underrepresentation of women
in open-source communities does not relate to gender bias of the communities.
