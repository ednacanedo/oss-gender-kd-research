Background: While FLOSS projects espouse openness and acceptance for all, in practice, female contributors often face discriminatory barriers to contribution. Aims: In this paper, we examine the extent to which these problems still exist. We also study male and female contributors’ perceptions of  other contributors. Method: We surveyed participants from 15 FLOSS projects, asking a series of open-ended, closed-ended, and behavioral scale questions to gather information about the issue of gender in FLOSS projects. Results: Though many of those we surveyed expressed a positive sentiment towards females who participate in FLOSS projects, some were still strongly against their inclusion. Often, the respondents who were against inclusiveness also believed their own sentiments were the prevailing belief in the community, contrary to our findings. Others did not see the purpose of attempting to be inclusive, expressing the sentiment that a discussion of gender has no place in FLOSS. Conclusions: FLOSS projects have started to move forwards in terms of gender acceptance. However, there is still a need for more progress in the inclusion of gender-diverse contributors.","Title: Going Farther Together: The Impact of Social Capital on Sustained Participation in Open Source Abstract. Sustained participation by contributors in opensource software is critical to the survival of open-source projects and can provide career advancement benefits to individual contributors. However, not all contributors reap the benefits of open-source participation fully, with prior work showing that women are particularly underrepresented and at higher risk of disengagement. While many barriers to participation in open-source have beendocumented in the literature, relatively little is known about how the social networks that open-source contributors form impact their chances of long-term engagement.  In this paper we report on a mixed-methods empirical study of the role of social capital (i.e., the resources people can gain from their social connections) for sustained participation by women and men in open-source GitHub projects. After combining survival analysis on a large, longitudinal data set with insights derived from a user survey, we confirm that while social capital is beneficial for prolonged engagement for both genders, women are at disadvantage in teams lacking diversity in expertise.","Title: Gender and Tenure Diversity in GitHub Teams Abstract. Software development is usually a collaborative venture. Open Source Software (OSS) projects are no exception; indeed, by design, the OSS approach can accommodate teams that are more open, geographically distributed, and dynamic than commercial teams. This, we find, leads to OSS teams that are quite diverse.  Team diversity, predominantly in offline  groups, is known to correlate with team output, mostly with positive effects. How about in OSS? Using GITHUB, the largest publicly available collection of OSS projects, we studied how gender and tenure diversity  relate to team productivity and turnover. Using regression modeling of GITHUB data and the results of a survey, we show that both gender and tenure diversity are positive and significant predictors of productivity, together explaining a sizable fraction of the data variability. These results can  inform decision making on all levels, leading to better outcomes in recruiting and performance.","Title: Gender Diversity and Women in Software Teams: How Do They Affect Community Smells?Abstract. As social as software engineers are, there is a known and established genderimbalance in our community  structures, regardless of their open- or closed-source nature. To shed light on the actual benefits of achieving such balance, this empirical study looks into the relations between such balance and the occurrence of community smells, that is, sub-optimal circumstances and patterns across the software organizational structure. Example of community smells are Organizational Silo effects (overly disconnected sub-groups) or Lone Wolves (defiant  community members). Results indicate that the presence of women generally reduces the amount of community smells. We  conclude that women are instrumental to reducing community smells in software development teams.","Title: Investigating the Effects of Gender Bias on GitHubAbstract. Diversity, including gender diversity, is valued by many software development organizations, yet the field remains dominated by men. One reason for this lack of diversity is gender bias. In this paper, we study the effects of that bias by using an existing framework derived from the gender studies literature. We adapt the four main effects proposed in the framework by posing hypotheses about how they might manifest on GitHub, then evaluate those hypotheses quantitatively. While our results show that effects of gender bias are largely invisible on the GitHub platform itself, there are still signals of women concentrating their work in fewer places and being more restrained in communication than men.","Title: Gender differences in participation and reward on Stack OverflowAbstract. Programming is a valuable skill in the labor market, making the underrepresentation of women in computing an increasingly important issue. Online question and answer platforms serve a dual purpose in this field: they form a body of knowledge useful as a reference and learning tool, and they provide opportunities for individuals to demonstrate credible, verifiable expertise. Issues, such as male-oriented site design or overrepresentation of men among the site’s elite may therefore compound the issue of women’s underrepresentation in IT. In this paper we audit the differences in behavior and outcomes between men and women on Stack Overflow, the most popular of these Q&A sites.We observe significant differences in how men and women participate in the platform and how successful they are. For example, the average woman has roughly half of the reputation points, the primary measure of success on the site, of the average man. Using an Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition, an econometric technique commonly applied to analyze differences in wages between groups, we find that most of the gap in success between men and women can be explained by differences in their activity on the site and differences in how these activities are rewarded. Specifically, 1) men give more answers than women and 2) are rewarded more for their answers on average, even when controlling for possible confounders such as tenure or buy-in to the site. Women ask more questions and gain more reward per question. We conclude with a hypothetical redesign of the site’s scoring system based on these behavioral differences, cutting the reputation gap in half.","Title: Gender Differences and Bias in Open Source: Pull Request Acceptance of Women Versus MenAbstract. Biases against women in the workplace have been documented in a variety of studies. This paper presents the largest study to date on gender bias, where we compare acceptance rates of contributions from men versus women in an open source software community. Surprisingly, our results show that women’s contributions tend to be accepted more often than men’s. However, women’s acceptance rates are higher only when they are not identifiable as women. Our results suggest that although women on GitHub may be more competent over- all, bias against them exists nonetheless.","Title: Designing for Inclusion: Supporting Gender Diversity in Independent Innovation TeamsAbstract. We study how independent innovation teams develop an en vironment of inclusion to support gender diversity. Through a mixed-methods study involving surveys and interviews with people involved in independent innovation, we sought to better understand the mechanisms by which their teams fostered a sense of inclusion to support gender diversity via interpersonal practices and communication and collaboration technology usage. By understanding how inclusion supports gender diversity, we discuss design implications to help more diverse independent innovation teams form and function.","Title: How Diverse Is Your Team? Investigating Gender and Nationality Diversity in GitHub TeamsAbstract. Building an effective team of developers is a complex task faced by both software companies and open source communities. The problem of forming a dream"" team involves many variables, including consideration of human factors, and it is not a dilemma solvable in a mathematical way. Empirical studies might provide interesting insights to explain which factors need to be taken into account in building a team of developers and which levers act to optimise collaboration and productivity among developers. In this paper, we present the results of an empirical study aimed at investigating the link between team diversity (i.e., gender, nationality) and productivity (issue xing time). We consider issues solved from the GHTorrent dataset inferring gender and nationality of each team's members.We also evaluate the politeness of all comments involved in issue resolution. Results show that higher gender diversity is linked with a lower team average issue xing time and that nationality diversity is linked with lower team politeness.","Title:  Implicit Gender Biases in Professional Software Development: An Empirical StudyAbstract. It has been well-known that the software development profession lacks gender diversity, particularly in the technical leadership positions. Researchers and practitioners have spent tremendous efforts on identifying the problems and finding solutions. However, most of the existing software engineering literature focuses on the explicit gender biases but ignores implicit gender biases. To fill this gap, the study sought to empirically investigate whether professional software engineers hold implicit gender biases related to women in the software development profession, and examine whether these implicit biases predict discriminatory decision-making. Using data from 142 professional software engineers in seven organizations, our study yields a rich set of concerning findings. First, we find that implicit biases were pervasive–both male and female software engineers implicitly associated software development professions, particular technical leadership roles, with men, not women, and also associated women with the home and family. Besides, people often cannot resist their implicit gender biases and make decisions in gender-neutral ways while they do well in resisting their explicit gender biases.","Title:  Confidence in Programming Skills: Gender Insights From StackOverflow Developers SurveyAbstract. Diversity is being intensively discussed by different knowledge areas of society and discussions in Software Engineering, are increasing as well. There are unconscious bias and lack of representativeness and when we talk about characteristics as ethnicity and gender, to mention a few. Studies say that diversity builds better teams and delivers better results, among other benefits. StackOverflow is a popular community question&answer forum, with a high engagement of software developers. Yearly, they apply a survey, present straightforward results, and made the anonymized results available for download, so it is possible to perform additional analysis beyond the original ones. Using data visualization techniques, we analyzed 2018 data to extract some insights about how genders see their confidence in programming skills. Results show that respondents from underrepresented groups tend to believe they are not as good as their peers. From that, we propose a discussion about the unconscious bias, stereotypes, and impostor syndrome and how to provide support on that.",Start Date (UTC),Submit Date (UTC),Network ID

You are much more likely to encourage women participation here. You will not limit yourself to attract women that have a classical computer science background, but e.g. women in earth system sciences, who are also technically inclined but have not come into direct contact with e.g. software development. You open up the pool of women to reach out to and you eliminate the danger of the 'I do not have enough skills for that' thinking.
