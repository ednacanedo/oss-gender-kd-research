| P1     | Communities can encourage woman as a co-mentor if they are not mentors, this will help women contributors to be more comfortable to interact with them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| P6     | Promote a general discussion/research on why women's participation is so low. There can be more than one reason. Usual "rude" behavior may be one of them, but not the only one. And it is important to consider that women's participation in Computing is currently also low, and has been higher.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| P23    | I feel that the solution is to build confidence. Every approach towards increasing participation of women has a side that increases confidence and another that decreases it. The one that I completely support is building a peer group among girls interested in it. It is not so common to find many girls in technical teams and also, it is not considered cool to be a techie girl. (There's a lot of peer pressure when you're not with people of common interests. That's what I felt until I actually told the truth and found my girly tech community). I'm a very introverted person. I rarely even communicate with anyone on those online chat platforms (even though we have a girls group over there as well). So, having people around me with whom I can share everything that I do every day without having a fear of being judged as a freak, has been pretty helpful and encouraging. |

| P26    | I started participating because I had the chance to get a little stipend for my open source work. After the initial incentive to top up by student budget I realized how much fun it is and stuck to it ever since. I think I would not have started without that, because it always seemed more like a guys hangout and usually you have to be of a very outgoing personality to make first friends in a guys only club.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

Otherwise, let know the woman not to fear when contributing, she will be treated just like anyone else: good contribution then its accepted regardless of gender, political views or religion, country of origin, etc., bad contributions are not accepted regardless of gender, political views or religion, country of origin, etc.                                                                                                              |

| P27    | Don't focus so much on 'important' very basic packages (e.g. Numpy, Scipy) but more on the smaller ones, e.g. important only in a couple specific domains (like PySAL or geopandas). You are much more likely to encourage women participation here. You will not limit yourself to attract women that have a classical computer science background, but e.g. women in earth system sciences, who are also technically inclined but have not come into direct contact with e.g. software development. You open up the pool of women to reach out to and you eliminate the danger of the 'I do not have enough skills for that' thinking. |

| P29    | Honestly, I wish I knew more about how to better support inclusivity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| P30    | Increase projects such as outreachy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| P31    | If OSS communities host overnight hackathons, make sure to provide more or less comfortable place to sleep.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| P32    | Have closed forums for women to talk about their experiences.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
